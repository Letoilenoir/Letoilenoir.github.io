## Tracing the Source

They came with cassette recorders making funny noises and took ages for a series of coloured squares to appear on a CRT screen - I was too busy making (analogue) music, so didn't pay much attention.

Then somewhere around the turn of the century the home computer started to turn up in, well, homes. 

Coral Draw was possibly the first thing that made me sit up and listen, along with "desktop publishing". and then Geocities arrived!

I started toying with code, in a very, very amateur way. I was far too involved in motorbikes to take it up seriously. 
However, gradually the computer started to become more integrated in my life.
Through forums I broadened my motorbiking community, and made lifelong friends through late night conversdations over the net using IM chatrooms
Many of these new friends and aquaintances were already working in IT (many are now retired!) using UNIX systems and various conversations led to me dabbling with installing Ubuntu on my PC!

But it was still just "something to do" in my spare time.

As the new century dawned I found myself relocating to the North West of England, and the internet became even more essential for staying in touch with everyone
Myspace came along and sort of mimicked the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">GeoCities</a> chaos - and creating an online presence became a thing.
