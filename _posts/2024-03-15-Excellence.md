It does have to be perfect to work. In fact sometimes getting the result is more important than how it is acheived.
As part of my journey I undertook to complete the FreeCodeCamp course <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft">Foundational C# with Microsoft</a>

The course collates various modules sourced from the Microsoft Learn catalogue, to build a rudimentary umderstandin of C#, with certification offerred at the end. In one of the sections dealing with "if, else if" statement the second challenge<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/csharp-evaluate-boolean-expressions/6-challenge-2">challenge</a> threw me for a while.
