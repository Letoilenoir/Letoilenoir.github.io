It doesn't have to be perfect to work. In fact sometimes getting the result is more important than how it is acheived.
As part of my journey I undertook to complete the FreeCodeCamp course <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft">Foundational C# with Microsoft</a>

The course collates various modules sourced from the Microsoft Learn catalogue, to build a rudimentary umderstanding of C#, with certification offerred at the end. In one of the sections dealing with "if, else if, if" statement the second <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/csharp-evaluate-boolean-expressions/6-challenge-2">challenge</a> threw me for a while.
My mind went blank, so i walked away from the challenge for a day or two.

Then I had an epiphany. How would i solve the challenge using an Excel formula? With a little thought it was obvious that a nested if statement would be one way of providing a solution! 

eg:  =if(B6="Admin","Welcome admin",if(B6="Manager","welcome manager","you do not have permission"))

It might not be a direct analogy, but drawing on my experince in another domain and working through the steps I would take helped me navigate through the syntax of C#

I may not be able to use this approch for every situation - if Excel formulas could do all programming tasks then arguably we wouldnt have the plethora of coding languages that we do - but maybe those decades working on them (not to mention Lotus 123!) havent been wasted after all!
