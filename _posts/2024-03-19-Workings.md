These are my study notes relating to  an exercise in Microsoft Learn <b><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/csharp-switch-case/3-challenge">Exercise - Complete a challenge activity using switch statement</a></b>


Quick breakdown of the code:
    <b>string sku = "01-MN-L";</b>

    string[] product = sku.Split('-');

    string type = "";
    string color = "";
    string size = "";

    if (product[0] == "01")
    {
        type = "Sweat shirt";
    } else if (product[0] == "02")
    {
        type = "T-Shirt";
    } else if (product[0] == "03")
    {
        type = "Sweat pants";
    }
    else
    {
        type = "Other";
    }
Because zero indexing is used, the first element of the product sku "01-MN=L" relates to the reference <b>product[0]</b><br> To construct the product code the delimiter "-" is used, so in the code <b> string[] product = sku.Split('-')</b> allows us to split the product code into its three elements 

Therefore:
* product[0] = "01" (type)
* product[1] = "MN" (color)
* product[2] = "L"  (size)

to convert the "if, else if, else" statement to a switch statement refact0 the code as follows:

    switch (product[0])
    {
        case "01":
        type = "Sweat shirt";
        break;

        case "02":
        type = "T-Shirt";
        break;
	
        case "03":
        type = "Sweat pants";
        break;
	
        default:
        type = "other";
        break;
    }

Continue through the remaining code refactoring the "if, else if, else" statement to "switch" statements as appropriate ;)
