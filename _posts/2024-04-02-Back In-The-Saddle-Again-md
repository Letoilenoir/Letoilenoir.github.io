#(Aerosmith not Geane Autry)
<p>Although Ive paused working through the freeCodeCamp course over Easter, I've been scouring my old laptops for the projects that I started towards the end of my degree.</p>
<p>Although there were not that many, they seem to be tilted towards .NET MVC projects, and my time has been occupied with re-familiarising my self with that particular framework approach</p>
