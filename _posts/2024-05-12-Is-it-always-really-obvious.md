There is an expression used by motorcyclists "ride like they are out to kill you".<br>
<p>Whilst this may seen rather sensationalist, it basic translates to "never assume that other users are fully cogniscent of the knowledge/circumstances that dictate your own behavior"<br>
<p>Now it may be that if you are reading this, you are already know how to comment out mutiple lines of code in C# with one easy action in Visual Studio.
However, if you are not then the following may be helpful.</p>
<p></p>Basically on Windows, highlight the code blocks you wish to comment out:
<img class="image" src="/docs/assets/commentOut.png">
then press then Control + K + C:
<img class="image" src="/docs/assets/commentedOut.png">

Apparently it used to be Control + /, but there appears to have been an issue in Visual Studio 2022
