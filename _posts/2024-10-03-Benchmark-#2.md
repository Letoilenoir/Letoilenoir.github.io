<li>Location</li>

Situated near the corner of the Church in Hawkshead <a href="https://w3w.co/ample.blockage.driving">(what3Words)</a> this bench looks out over the rooftops of the houses in Main Street in the village.

Its elevated postion gives marvellous views of the surrounding dells. 
A set of (steep) steps lead up to the church from the south at <a href="https://w3w.co/)impact.toothpick.spires">The Square</a>, or there is a winding path that snakes up from the north, accessed from <a href="https://w3w.co/october.clay.whiplash">Main Steet</a>.


<li>View</li>
This bench benefits from an elevated postion, being relatively high in the vilage and, as a consequence, enjoys stunning views over the rooftops to the entrancing dells . 

Unfortunately we only have the one picture in our archives so wiill have to revisit to get some more shots! :)

<li>Comfort</li>
The bench istelf is a solid wooden one, of modern construction. 

The seat is slightly concave, whilst the backrest is mildly convex, making the bench comfortable to sit on.
It rests on three old recycled headstones, so is solidly planted and level.

There are no trees near to the bench, so is only shaded when the sun is behind the church. 

Consequently, it is pleasant to pause here on a mildly sunny day, as the height makes the most of any breeze that may be about.
Again, because of its elevation and location, it is a quiet and peaceful spot to sit down after perusing the local shops or visiting the museums in the village.
