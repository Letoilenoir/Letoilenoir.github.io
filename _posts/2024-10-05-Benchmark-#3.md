<li>Location</li>

Perched in the ruins of an annex at Castell Cricieth <a href="https://w3w.co/nosedive.elect.acted">(what3Words)</a> this bench looks out across Cerdigion Bay, perhaps from its northern most point.
The castle is in the care of CADW, so there is an entrance fee if you are not a member, although if you have held English Heritage membership for over a year then admission is also free.


<li>View</li>
Perched on a rocky outcrop the castle dominates the town of Cricieth, fFrom this bench to the west stretches the promenade and beach of Min-y-Mor

<li>Comfort</li>
The bench itself is a solid wooden one, of modern construction. 

The seat is slightly concave, with a vertical back, making the bench comfortable to sit on.
As it sits on the floor of a fortress dating back to the 14th Century, it is solidly planted and level.
It is however very exposed as only the wall to the rear of the bench affords any protection from the elements.
On a fine day it rewards having made the climb up to the castle from the visitor centre below, although the wind from the Irish see can be quite bracing

There are no trees near to the bench, so it offers no shade.
