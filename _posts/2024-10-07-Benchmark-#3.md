<li>Location</li>

Perched in the ruins of an annex at Castell Cricieth <a href="https://w3w.co/nosedive.elect.acted">(what3Words)</a> this bench looks out across Cerdigion Bay, perhaps from its northern most point.


The castle is in the care of CADW, so there is an entrance fee if you are not a member, although if you have held English Heritage membership for over a year then admission is also free.

to  <a href="https://w3w.co/)impact.toothpick.spires">The Square</a>, or there is a winding path that snakes up from the north, accessed from <a href="https://w3w.co/october.clay.whiplash">Main Steet</a>.


<li>View</li>
This bench benefits from an elevated postion, being relatively high in the village and, as a consequence, enjoys stunning views over the rooftops to the entrancing dells . 

Unfortunately we only have the one picture in our archives so will have to revisit to get some more shots! :)

<li>Comfort</li>
The bench itself is a solid wooden one, of modern construction. 

The seat is slightly concave, with a vertical back, making the bench comfortable to sit on.
As it sits on the floor of a fortress dating back to the 14th Century, it is solidly planted and level.
It is however very exposed as only the wall to the rear of the bench affords any protection from the elements.
On a fine day it rewards having made the climb up to the castle from the visitor centre below, although the wind from the Irish see can be quite bracing

There are no trees near to the bench, so is only shaded when the sun is behind the church. 

Consequently, it is pleasant to pause here on a mildly sunny day, as the height makes the most of any breeze that may be about.
Again, because of its elevation and location, it is a quiet and peaceful spot to sit down after perusing the local shops or visiting the museums in the village.
