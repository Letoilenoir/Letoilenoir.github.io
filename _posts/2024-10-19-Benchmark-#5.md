<p>We are sitting in the Heritage Cafe awaiting toast and coffee. It is late in October, early Saturday morning.<br>
There is a slight chill in the air, but it is not yet hat scarf and gloves weather<br>
The recent heavy downpours have subsided but the ground is waterlogged.<br>
The cafe is not busy at the moment, there are a few people with their dogs (its dog friendly) but it will fill out later a families with children and prams arrive to enjoy the park. 
The dogs are well behaved at the moment and there is a murmur of conversation. Later it will be a cacophony and the relative tranquility will fade. If you enjoy peace best to arrive early. </p>

<p>The pale autumn sun starts to straem through the leaded lights as we finish our drinks and head off into the partk itself</p>
