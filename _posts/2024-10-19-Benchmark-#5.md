<p>We are sitting in the Heritage Cafe awaiting toast and coffee.<br>
It is late in October, early Saturday morning.<br>
There is a slight chill in the air, but it is not yet hat, scarf and gloves weather<br>
The recent heavy downpours have subsided, but the ground is still waterlogged.<br>
The cafe is not busy at the moment, there are a few people with their dogs (it's a dog friendly place) but it will fill out later as families with children and prams arrive to enjoy the park. 
The dogs are well behaved at the moment, and there is a murmur of conversation. <br>
Later it will be a cacophony and the relative tranquility will fade. If you enjoy peace best to arrive early. </p>

<p>The pale autumn sun starts to straem through the leaded lights as we finish our drinks and head off into the partk itself</p>
