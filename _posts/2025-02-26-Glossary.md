So what is the client side? 

From ChatGPT:

"Client-side" in programming refers to everything that happens on the user's device (like a computer, phone, or tablet) rather than on a remote server. 
This includes things like web pages displaying content, buttons responding to clicks, and animations running smoothly in a browser.

For example, when you visit a website, the text, images, and interactive elements you see are handled by client-side code, often written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This allows the website to respond quickly without needing to constantly communicate with a server.
