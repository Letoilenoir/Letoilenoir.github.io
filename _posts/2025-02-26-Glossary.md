Client Side
	
<a href="https://dev.to/crypto3p/javascript-explained-introduction-2i5i">We'll be looking at the JavaScript from the client side perspective (front end)</a>	


<b>What is the client side?<b> 

From ChatGPT:

"Client-side" in programming refers to everything that happens on the user's device (like a computer, phone, or tablet) rather than on a remote server. 
This includes things like web pages displaying content, buttons responding to clicks, and animations running smoothly in a browser.

For example, when you visit a website, the text, images, and interactive elements you see are handled by client-side code, often written in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This allows the website to respond quickly without needing to constantly communicate with a server.

So what does Javascript do on the Client Side?

<a href="https://www.ironhack.com/gb/blog/understanding-javascript-the-basics-of-client-side-web-development">On the client side, JavaScriptâ€™s dynamic nature helps create visually appealing websites that feature images, graphics, different colors, and other marketing tools used to grab your attention.</a>

So, effectively its "window dressing" for data from the web on your laptop

<b>Is JavaScript OOP (Object Oriented Programing)?</b> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107464/is-javascript-object-oriented">Yes........and no.</a>

Strictly speaaking OOP requires encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance - javascript can do the first two, but to do the third the first has to be sacrificed.
So, although this answer may be ambiguous, if it helps when writing reading and understanding JS to apply OO principles, then its a victimless crime to consider it OOP.
