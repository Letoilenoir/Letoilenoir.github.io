Following of from introducing the Chord Python Script I decided to investigate the possibility of hosting the script via FLASK

Although this tutorial <a href="https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/">Python Web Applications: Deploy Your Script as a Flask App</a> is now a few years old it provided a guide to the steps involved in setting this up.<br><BR>
I had to spend some time sorting out the Python installation as apparently there is a known issue with version from Microsoft Store<br> This entailed removing the installed ones, as well as removing registry keys that kept invoking the MS version, but I persevered & got the app working locally.
