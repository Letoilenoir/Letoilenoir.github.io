Following of from introducing the Chord Python Script I decided to investigate the possibility of hosting the script via FLASK

Although this tutorial <ahref= "https://realpython.com/python-web-applications/">Python Web Applications: Deploy Your Script as a Flask App</a> is now a few years old it provided a guide to the steps involved in setting this up.<br>
I had to spend some time sorting out the Python installation as apparently there is a known issue with version from Microsoft Store<br> I had to remove the installed ones, as well as remove registry keys that kept invoking the MS version, but persevered & got the app working locally.
