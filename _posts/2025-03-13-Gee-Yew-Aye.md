Although the tkinter GUI is adequate for the stand alone Chords Python script, a more polished interface may be appropriate for a web based application. <br>
Below are are two variations created using the <a href="https://github.com/pygame/pygame">pygame</a> library<br>

There are also a couple of enhacements made from the original <a href="https://github.com/Letoilenoir/chord/blob/main/chordTen.py">Chords</a> script, although the prototypes displayed are still purely python scripts, they have a more interactive feel.

Both contain options to create chord progressions with or without key signatures.<br>
Both show the selections added to the progression in the "Current Progression" frame<br>
When chosing to use a chord progression the first will display the only the root notes available in that key signature:

By selecting and and adding one to the progression, the next root note in the scale will automatically be highlighted:
