Although the tkinter GUI is adequate for the stand alone Chords Python script, a more polished interface may be appropriate for a web based application. <br>
Below are are two variations created using the <a href="https://github.com/pygame/pygame">pygame</a> library<br> 
<img class="image" src="/docs/assets/UI.png" width = "100%"><br>
There are also a couple of enhamcements made from the original <a href="https://github.com/Letoilenoir/chord/blob/main/chordTen.py">Chords</a>, although the prototypes displayed are still purely python scripts, they have a more interactive feel.

Both contain options to create chord proghressions with or without key signatures.<br>
Both show the selections added to the progression in the "Current Progression" frame<br>
